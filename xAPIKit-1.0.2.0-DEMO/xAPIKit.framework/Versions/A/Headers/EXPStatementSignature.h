/**
 A Statement may include a digital signature to provide strong and durable evidence of the authenticity and integrity of the Statement.
 
 NOTE: Statement signing only works on iOS 6 and later.
 
 Some Statements will have regulatory or legal significance, or otherwise require strong and durable evidence of their authenticity and integrity. It may be necessary to verify these Statements without trusting the system they were first recorded in, or perhaps without access to that system. Digital signatures will enable a third-party system to validate such Statements.
 
 Currently, the xAPI iOS SDK only supports the RS256 signing algorithm. Signing credentials must be provided using a PKCS12 file. In the future, the SDK may allow for signing statements using data from the device's keychain. If this would be useful, let us know.
 
 Regardless if you are including the PKCS12 file in the distributable or downloading the data from a remote server at runtime, it is STRONGLY recommended that the PKCS12 file be protected with a passphrase AND that the passphrase is atleast 20 characters long containing both numbers and symbols. The passphrase is what will protect your PKCS12 from unauthorized parties. Since the PKCS12 file contains your private key, this is imparative to the integrity of the private key. By having a passphrase that is atleast 20 characters long with both numbers and symbols, it greatly reduces (to the point of it being statistically impossible over the course of a lifetime) the chance of your PKCS12 being cracked open.
 
 Note: Although a PKCS12 file can contain multiple items, the SDK will only read the first item.
 
 The signatures are created following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) specification. However, the SDK does all the work. All you need to do is provide the signing credentials.
 
 When signed statements are received from the LRS, the signature will contain the certificateChain data will contain the certificate chain of the signing identity.
 IMPORTANT: The SDK does NOT validate signatures returned from the LRS. It is your responsibility to inspect the certificate chain and determine if the statement is signed by a trusted source.
